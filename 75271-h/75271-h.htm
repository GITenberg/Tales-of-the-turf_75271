<p class="drop-cap">THE publisher feels highly honored at being
able, at this time, to present to the American
public, from the pen of America’s foremost
sports-writer and recognized authority, Hugh S.
Fullerton, these stories of the American Turf,
feeling sanguine that these tales, saturated with
human interest, will be digested with as much
pleasure and delight as the author took in writing
and the publisher in publishing them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALL men love a horse who know a horse. The
love of contest and struggle forms a kinship
between man and horse that exists between no
others. It is the gameness, the courage, the
fighting spirit of the thoroughbred which
arouses in man the finest instincts, and it is these
qualities that cause the love of man for the
thoroughbred. It is noticeable too, that the
thoroughbred horse loves only those human
beings who possess those same qualities.</p>

<p>On the race-track we find the only pure
democracy of the world, a democracy which
includes all classes, all strata of society. It is
more liberal, more forgiving of human frailties
and human weakness, than any other place, because
men who know racing understand how
hearts break when the weight cloths are too
heavy and the distance too great.</p>

<p>These little tales of the turf are based upon
real incidents and real characters. Perhaps
those lovers of racing who have lived the life
will recognize the characters, and to those I
would plead that they extend to them the same
broad understanding and forgiveness that they
give to the tout, the cadger, and the down and
outer in real life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">“HARDSHELL” GAINES</h2>
</div>

<p>“Hardshell” Gaines was the only name we
knew him by, although had anyone been sufficiently
interested to look through the list of registered
owners of race-horses, he would have
learned that Hardshell had been christened
James Buchanan Gaines. The name might also
have furnished a clue as to his age.</p>

<p>Tradition was that he came from somewhere
in Pennsylvania, as he spoke sometimes of the
horses “up the valley”; but beyond the fact that
he had a farm in Tennessee, where he bred and
trained the horses he raced, nothing was set
down in the “Who’s Who” of the turf. He was
called Hardshell because he had once explained
the difference between the Hardshell Baptists,
to which denomination he belonged, and the
Washfoots.</p>

<p>He was an old man, thin and poorly dressed
in baggy garments which carried the odor of
horses and were covered with horse hairs. He
loved horses, lived with them and for them and
by them. In those days he emerged from his
hibernation on the Tennessee farm when racing
started at New Orleans and moved northward
to Memphis, Louisville, Cincinnati, St. Louis,
and Chicago, and in the fall he retraced the
route and disappeared. He usually could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
found working with some horse and humming
an old hymn, and occasionally, when forgetful,
he sang hymns aloud while brushing the horses.</p>

<p>He was honest, which fact set him apart from
the majority of the persons who follow horse-racing.
According to the unwritten law of the
turf, it was all right for a millionaire to race
horses for sport and the purses, but a poor man
was expected to do the best he could, dodge the
feed man’s bill when possible, get a shade the
best of the odds, keep under cover the fact that
one of his horses was fit for a race until the odds
were right, and, if possible, sell one or two colts
to the wealthy owners at a fancy price to even
the losses on the season.</p>

<p>Hardshell Gaines violated all these rules. He
was poor. He bred and raced horses because
he loved them and loved the sport. He wagered
two dollars on each horse he entered in a race,
never more or less. He depended upon winning
purses to meet expenses, and he refused to sell
his best colts at any price. Each year he emerged
from Tennessee with three or four fair selling-platers,
a string of two-year-olds from which he
hoped to develop a champion, and Sword of
Gideon, better known as Swored at Gideon, his
alleged stake horse and the pride of the Big
Bend stables.</p>

<p>Some of the race followers believed Hardshell
to be rich. The suspicious ones (and suspicion
has its breeding place on race-tracks) thought
the old man laid big bets through secret agents
whenever he was ready to win a race. When,
at not too frequent intervals, one of his horses
won, the wise ones nodded and whispered that
old Hardshell had made another killing. Others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
of us who knew how many of the purses offered
in selling races must be won to feed, care for,
and transport eighteen or twenty horses, estimated
his financial rating more closely. I knew
there were times when second or third money in
cheap races was welcome to help pay feed bills
and jockey fees, and that in several lean times
colts had disappeared from the Big Bend stables,
having been sold secretly at low prices.</p>

<p>No one ever heard Hardshell complain. His
health was always “tol’able,” his horses were
always “tol’able fast,” his luck was “tol’able,”
and after replying thus to inquiries he hummed
a hymn and went away. He never was with the
crowd of owners and bookmakers around hotels
or restaurants, but lived in the stables; and when
little Pete, the diminutive negro jockey, rode
out of the paddock, Hardshell, a timothy straw
in his mouth and trousers laced into the tops of
disreputable boots, sauntered into the betting
ring, went to the stand of a bookmaker who had
been his friend for years, wagered two dollars
that his horse would win, and, without looking
to see what the odds were, went down to the rail
to root for his horse.</p>

<p>Few knew that Hardshell cherished either an
ambition or an enmity—but he did. His ambition
was to breed and train a champion colt, and
the object of his hatred was Big Jim Long,
gambler, bookmaker, sure thing man, and the
head of the Long Investment Company—and the
ambition and the hatred were associated.</p>

<p>Long was the Long Investment Company so
far as advertising and general knowledge went,
but the real head sat at a desk in a suite of
offices in the lower Broadway district in New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
York, and, so far as anyone knew, never had
been near a race-track. Not even his name was
to be found in connection with the Long Investment
Company. All letters, remittances, and
transfers from branch offices were addressed to
James Long, but the man who opened them was
Thomas J. Kirtin, whose business, according to
the modest lettering on the door of the back
room, which opened upon an entirely different
corridor from that upon which the Long Investment
Company fronted, was “Investments.”</p>

<p>Kirtin’s brain had evolved the idea of applying
the all Tontine game to betting upon horse-races,
and he had organized the Long Investment
Company. In addition to the promise of certain
dividends, the company added the appeal to the
gambling instinct in human beings. It claimed
that the reason persons who bet upon horse-races
fail to beat the bookmakers is that the bookmakers
have the preponderance of capital. The
small bettor could not withstand a run of losses
and the gamblers could. It proposed to turn the
tables: all bettors were to pool their capital with
the Long Investment Company, which, with its
elaborate system of doping horse-races, its exclusive
sources of information from owners and
jockeys who were “interested,” and its perfect
system of laying bets which would assure investors
of the best odds on each race, would beat
the game. Further, it was not as if a bettor
wagered all on one race; the company would bet
on three, four, possibly six, races a day on different
tracks, betting only on inside information,
and the winnings would be pooled and divided.
One hundred per cent was guaranteed, and more
if the winnings were larger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>The public had shied at the proposition at
first. Then those who had been lured by golden
promises commenced to draw ten, fifteen, even
twenty-five, per cent a month on their investments.
On one occasion a “dividend” of seventy
per cent was declared. The first investors
had their money back and still were credited
with the original investment. The news was
received with incredulity, but as more and
greater dividends were declared hundreds and
then thousands had flocked to invest. Branch
offices of the company, lavishly furnished and
equipped with telegraph and telephone communications
with all tracks, were established in a
score of cities. Money poured into the Long
Investment Company by tens of thousands, then
almost by millions. Each month the “investors”
received astonishing dividends. Some perhaps
knew or suspected that the dividends were
being paid out of the fresh capital, but, being
gamblers, they threw their money into the gamble,
betting that they would draw out their principal
and more before the bubble burst.</p>

<p>In New York, Kirtin waited, watching the
expansion of the bubble and timing almost to
the hour when the crash must come. In his safe
nearly fifty per cent of the money received,
changed into bills of large denominations, was
packed in cases, and in his desk were reservations
of staterooms on every vessel departing for
Europe in the next fortnight. The bubble had
endured longer than he expected. There was
more than a million dollars packed in the cases,
and more than that amount already had been
transferred and deposited in various European
banks. He hesitated, undecided as to whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
to risk another week of delay—and decided that
the time had come to reap the last harvest and
permit the gleanings to remain.</p>

<p>On the race-tracks Big Jim Long swaggered
and continued his rôle as head of the company
spending thousands and talking millions. He
was a huge man, with a huge laugh, a round,
ruddy face pink from much massage. He wore
clothing of striking cut and colors, and his diamonds
dazzled the eyes of jockeys and touts. He
maintained an air of condescending familiarity
with some and patronizing good fellowship with
others, and he treated money as dross. Judges,
stewards, and club officials watched Long closely
and with some disappointment. Rumors that he
had bribed jockeys, had influenced owners, that
he had fixed races and engineered great killings,
were whispered around the tracks, yet the officials
could not discover any evidences of his
guilt. Big Jim made no denials of the whispered
accusations, but blatantly defied the officials
to “get anything on him.” Moreover, the
bookmakers, who watched his movements even
more closely than the racing officials did, knew
that he never had bet any large sums at the
track, and Big Jim had sarcastically inquired if
they thought him a fool to make bets for the
company at the tracks, where the odds were
made, when the company system was to scatter
the bets over a score of cities and get better
odds. Such bets as he made at the tracks were
for his own account, and generally he lost, so
that the small bettors who spied upon him, hoping
to learn which horses the company were
backing, suspected that he bet to blind them to
the real identity of the horses the “killings”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
were made on. They believed that the Long
Investment Company was winning vast sums.
As a matter of fact, the Long Investment Company
did not bet at all. Kirtin did not believe
in gambling. Yet, oddly enough, Big Jim Long
believed firmly and unshakably that, if he had
complete control of the finances of the company,
he could beat the races. He was convinced
that with the capital of the Long Investment
Company he could corrupt enough jockeys and
owners to pay dividends legitimately and make
a fortune for himself. Long would have been
an easy victim of the game which he was helping
perpetrate upon the public. Kirtin had no
such illusions. Long had once argued the point
with Kirtin in the privacy of the back room in
New York, and Kirtin had called him a fool,
with variations, prefix and addenda. And, as
Kirtin sent him five thousand dollars a week
with which to keep up the front of the Long
Investment Company, Long had not pressed the
point. Neither had he been convinced.</p>

<p>It was against Big Jim Long that Hardshell
Gaines cherished the one hatred of his life. It
had started when Long sought to amuse himself
and his friends by ridiculing Gaines and his
stable. He had joked at the old man’s clothes,
at his stable, his colors, and his jockey—and
then had made the fatal blunder of ridiculing
Sword of Gideon, calling him a “hound.”</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing else would have aroused
vengeful hate in the bosom of Hardshell, but to
speak scornfully of Sword of Gideon was the
unbearable insult. The Sword was Hardshell’s
weakness, the consummation of his life’s ambition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
gone wrong. It was as if he had reared a
strong, handsome son and seen him crippled and
then laughed at.</p>

<p>Hardshell had bred and reared the colt and
named him, as he did all his other colts, from
the Bible. As a two-year-old, racing against
the best of the baby thoroughbreds of the West,
the Sword had shown stamina, gameness, a
racing instinct, and a dazzling burst of speed.
He was royally sired, and even the millionaire
owners agreed that Hardshell had at last produced
a great colt. In mid-season he was rated
as one of the two best two-year-olds of the year,
and offers of large sums were made for him. He
was eligible to race in all the big three-year-old
stake races the next season, and Hardshell had
refused to listen to any offer or set any price.
He had set out to develop a champion racer
down there on the little farm in the Big Bend
of the Tennessee, a champion which would outrun
and outgame the best of the country and
win the American derby—then the greatest of
all turf prizes.</p>

<p>Late in August the thing happened. The colt
was at the starting post in a six-furlong dash
on the Hawthorne track when the barrier, a
band of elastic, was broken by the lunging of
another colt. The elastic band struck Sword of
Gideon in the eye and maddened him with
fright and pain. The accident seemed trivial,
but the effect was the destruction of Hardshell’s
life dream. Never thereafter would Sword of
Gideon face the barrier without a fight. The
memory of the stinging agony of that flying
elastic was not to be effaced. A dozen times
exasperated starters ordered him out of races<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
and sent him back for further schooling at the
barrier. Schooling was useless. He refused to
face the thing which had hurt him. The only
way in which he could be handled at the start
of a race was for the jockey to turn his head
away from the barrier, wait until the other
horses started, then throw him around and send
him after the flying field. Occasionally when
the jockey swung him at the right second he had
a chance to win. The majority of times he was
handicapped five or six lengths on every start,
and not infrequently when he heard the swish
of the barrier he bolted the wrong way of the
track. Look in the guide and after his name in
many races you will find the brief record of a
tragedy in the words, “Left at post.”</p>

<p>The champion was ruined. But in the heart
of Hardshell Gaines Sword of Gideon still was
the champion. He worked over him as tenderly
as a mother over a crippled child, and for him
he sang his favorite hymns, as if striving to comfort
the horse when he had behaved badly at the
post. The newspapers, on account of his bad acting
at the start, wrote of him as “Swored at
Gideon.”</p>

<p>Big Jim Long had called the Sword a
“hound,” and thereafter Hardshell never spoke
to him but passed him unseeing. At the bar one
day Big Jim had noisily invited everyone to
drink with him, and Hardshell had thrown
away his beer and spat before walking away—and
the open insult stung even Big Jim Long.</p>

<p>All this was three years prior to the day when
the affairs of the Long Investment Company
reached their climax. In his New York offices,
Kirtin realized that the finish was at hand. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
bags filled with money had been removed from
the safe in the luxurious offices of the Long Investment
Company, carried through the door
connecting them with the little office of Thos. J.
Kirtin, Investments, and the door locked on
both sides. Then Kirtin did the one decent thing
of his career. He sent a code telegram to Long
and to every agent of the company over the
ganglia of leased wires, warning them that the
jig was up and it was time to disappear.</p>

<p>Probably it was not until he read that message
that Big Jim Long understood the full significance
of the situation. He never had stopped
to ask himself why Kirtin had bestowed rank
and titles upon him, why he had elected him
president, and why all the ornate stationery and
the many messages bore his name, or even why
he had been paid five thousand dollars a week.
Perhaps he thought he earned it by virtue of
his influence among racing people. He understood
now that he, Jim Long, would be held
accountable to the law, that he would be fugitive
or prisoner while Kirtin, with the millions
of dollars looted from the public, could not be
connected with the swindle and would be safe in
Europe.</p>

<p>He cursed Kirtin, and, strangely, not because
Kirtin was a thief and worse. He cursed him
because he considered Kirtin a fool. Had Kirtin
followed his plan and advice, the scheme
would have worked. With that almost unlimited
capital behind him he could have fixed enough
races and won enough money to pay the dividends.</p>

<p>Long knew that within a day or two, three at
the longest, the authorities would descend upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the company offices. With a sudden determination,
Long sent a code order to every agent of
the company to ignore Kirtin’s message and prepare
for a killing.</p>

<p>Let Kirtin go his cowardly way. He, Big
Jim Long, would face the situation, pay the dividends,
and handle the big money himself. He
knew that at least a half million dollars remained
in the hands of the agents of the company
in different cities—the gleanings which
Kirtin had not considered worth the risk to
remain and collect. Long telegraphed, ordering
the agents to hold all funds subject to his order
instead of forwarding them to New York.</p>

<p>Kirtin, busy clearing the desk in his office and
destroying the last papers that would reveal
any connection between Kirtin, Investments,
and the Long Investment Company, heard the
news and shrugged his shoulders. He had tried
to save the fools, and if they refused to be saved
it was none of his affair. An hour later he and
his suitcases were in the stateroom of a liner.</p>

<p>At the Fair Grounds track in St. Louis, Big
Jim Long set to work hastily to stave off disaster
and revive the investment company. He had
considered telegraphing the authorities to hold
Kirtin, but had rejected the plan as unbecoming
one in his profession. Long’s plan of procedure
was simple and direct. He would fix a race,
pay the horse owners well, and win enough
money to declare another dividend, restoring
the faith of the investors, who already had begun
to show signs of uneasiness as rumors
spread. It was not a problem of morals but of
mathematics.</p>

<p>The chief obstacle to his plan was lack of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
time, and he knew he must act rapidly. Already
the rumors that the Long Investment Company
was in trouble had spread through the uneasy
ranks of the gamblers, and Long knew the first
one who informed a district attorney of the
affairs of the company would bring the avalanche.
By rapid work he completed his preliminary
plans during the races that afternoon.
An overnight handicap was carded for the next
day’s races, and Long selected eight owners
whose morals he knew were below the par even
of racing and each agreed to enter a horse in
the race. The chief problem was to prevent
other owners from naming their horses to start,
and to avoid this one owner agreed to enter Attorney
Jackson, a high-class racer, to frighten
owners of slower horses out.</p>

<p>That evening a caucus was held. Besides
Long, eight owners were present. It was agreed
that with Attorney Jackson the favorite, the
odds against Mildred Rogers would be at least
fifteen to one, therefore by simple arithmetic
Mildred Rogers should win, because fifteen times
one is fifteen, whereas two times one is two. Long
intended to bet the remnants of the capital of the
investment company, and, figuring the price
would recede from fifteen or twenty to one to
ten to one before the money was placed, he estimated
that he would win close to five million
dollars. Not a cent was to be wagered at the
track.</p>

<p>The caucus, after nominating Mildred Rogers
to win, decided that Attorney Jackson was to
make the early running, cutting out a terrific

and Pretty Dehon were to come up fast, crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the leader far outside on the turn, allowing
Mildred Rogers to come through along the rail,
after which the entire field was to bunch behind
her and shoo her home a winner, while Attorney
Jackson pulled up as if lame.</p>

<p>The rehearsal was progressing satisfactorily
and each owner was receiving instructions as to
the way his horse should run. The caucus was
pleased. Long had agreed that he would bet at
least four hundred thousand dollars, and that he
would give twenty-five per cent of the total winnings
to the owners. The eight who were playing
deuces wild in the sport of kings were calculating
that they would divide at least a million
dollars among themselves when the disquieting
news arrived.</p>

<p>“What the hell do you think of that?” Sorgan,
owner of Patsy Frewen, demanded. “Old
Hardshell Gaines has entered old Swored at
Gideon.”</p>

<p>There were a chorus of curses.</p>

<p>“That hound of his ain’t got a chanst,” declared
Kinsley. “It’s ten to one he runs the
wrong way of the track.”</p>

<p>“He’s the worst actor at the post on the circuit,”
said Stanley.</p>

<p>“He’s liable to bust up the start.”</p>

<p>“Better pick one of our horses to bump him
and put him over a fence,” snarled McGuire.
“He ain’t got any business in this. He knows
Attorney Jackson can beat him.”</p>

<p>It was a testimonial to his reputation for
honesty that not one of the assembled crooks
even suggested asking Gaines to enter the conspiracy.
They cursed him for an interfering old
fool, they cursed his stubbornness, they cursed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
his idiocy in still insisting that Sword of Gideon
was a stake horse, they cursed his supposed parsimony
and believed he had entered his aged
racer in the hope of winning a few dollars by
getting the place or show money. Not one suspected
that anything excepting blind chance
had caused him to enter his horse in the race.</p>

<p>They were wrong. Hardshell Gaines, with an
unsullied record of fifty years on the turf, had
heard something. He had seen Long in conference
with some owners, and when the same owners
rushed to enter their horses in the overnight
handicap Gaines’ suspicion had become certainty.
He had entered Sword of Gideon in the
handicap, and for an hour afterward had rubbed
and stroked the old campaigner, and as he
rolled bandages around the bad leg of the old
horse and applied liniment to his throat, he had
hummed a hymn.</p>

<p>Occasionally his voice rose in song and he
sang of the time when “the wicked cease from
troubling and the weary are at rest.” It was
after dark when he entered the Laclede downtown
and sought out the assistant starter.</p>

<p>“Joe,” he said solemnly, “I have been in this
game, man an’ boy, clost to fifty year and tried
to run straight and do right as a hossman and
a Baptist. No man can say James Buchanan
Gaines owes him a cent or ever done a dishonest
thing. I’ve done had a wrastle with my conscience,
and consarn me if I believe it’s wrong
to skin a skunk!”</p>

<p>Joe nodded approval.</p>

<p>“There’s something doing, Joe,” said Hardshell.
“Eight of them owners and that slick
crook Jim Long is holdin’ a caucus. Nary a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
word to old Hardshell, and the Sword is entered.”</p>

<p>Joe nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>“Lissen, Joe,” said Hardshell, lowering his
voice. “Long is planning a big killing, and it’s
up to me and the Sword and you to stop him.
The Sword is good for once, if that nigh left leg
don’t overheat. He can beat any hoss in that
race, ’ceptin’ Attorney Jackson, and I reckon
they ain’t plannin’ to have no favorite win.”</p>

<p>Joe nodded again and reserved speech, waiting
for the proposition.</p>

<p>“I ain’t asking no man to do anything dishonest,
Joe,” the old man went on—“it’s agin
my religion and my conscience too—but something’s
<i>got</i> to be done.”</p>

<p>Hardshell waited expectantly and hummed
“When temptation sore assails me,” hoping
that Joe would indicate his attitude or show receptivity,
but the assistant starter nodded and
smoked in silence.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t as if I was trying to bribe anyone,”
Hardshell explained painfully. “I don’t
want no one to do anything that is agin his
conscience.”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?” Joe asked,
breaking his silence.</p>

<p>“All I ask is that you help the Sword get off
straight, and me and you and the Sword’ll spile
the crookedest plan ever hatched.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t any law against my helping a bad
actor get off right,” said Joe.</p>

<p>Hardshell said no more. He gripped Joe’s
hand hard, and, after buying him a cigar,
strolled away, humming “Come, Holy Spirit,
Heavenly Love, with all thy quickening powers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>There was an air of uneasiness hanging over
the betting ring at the Fair Grounds track as
the horses hand-galloped to the starting post in
the fourth race. The air was surcharged with
expectancy. Judges, always alert and watching
for signs of dishonesty, stared at the horses and
received frequent bulletins from the betting
ring. Bookmakers, fearful of a sudden attack
by betting commissioners backing a certain
horse, held their chalk and erasers ready for
rapid use. Bettors, hearing vague whispers of
“something doing,” asked each other excitedly
what was being played. Yet everything in the
betting ring, paddock, and stand seemed tranquil.
The betting was light. Attorney Jackson
was favorite at seven to five, Patsy Frewen the
second choice, at two to one, the others at odds
of from four to twenty, with Mildred Rogers
ranging from fifteen to twenty to one and only
a few scattered bets registered on her. Yet
from a score of cities all over America came
frantic telegrams to gamblers, bookies, and
owners, asking for track odds and inquiring the
meaning of the terrific plunging on Mildred
Rogers. Big Jim Long, using the efficient organization
of the company, was betting the remaining
funds of the concern. More than fifty
thousand was bet in Chicago, thirty thousand in
Louisville, twenty thousand in Cincinnati, then
twelve thousand or more in other cities in which
the Long Investment Company had offices.</p>

<p>There was a last minute plunge on Mildred
Rogers at St. Louis by gamblers who had heard
the news from outside, and the odds dropped
quickly from fifteen to four to one.</p>

<p>As he tightened the girth for the last time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Hardshell Gaines whispered to Pete, his jockey:</p>

<p>“Take a toe holt and a tooth holt, Pete. Joe’ll
git you off a-runnin’, and I got a pill in him
that’d blow up a bank. It’s timed to go off
about the half-mile if you ain’t too long at the
post. All you got to do is sit still and hold on.”</p>

<p>Humming, he went to the book of his friend
and wagered two dollars that Sword of Gideon
would win. He was still humming when he
went down to the rail to watch the horses start,
and the hymn he hummed was, “Oh, for a
thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer’s
praise.”</p>

<p>Out by the barrier a perspiring starter was
beseeching, swearing, threatening, and scolding,
while a row of horses milled and maneuvered for
position. In the midst of the mêlée of milling
horses, Joe, the assistant starter, a buggy whip in
one hand, sweated and swore as he appeared to
be striving to make Sword of Gideon line up
with the other horses. Out of the corner of his
eye Joe watched the starter for the telltale movement
which revealed the second that the starter
would spring the barrier.</p>

<p>When that movement came Joe held the bridle
bit of Sword of Gideon, and before the barrier
flashed he threw the horse’s head around, leaped
aside, and slashed him sharply across the quarters
with the whip.</p>

<p>Sword of Gideon, stung into forgetfulness of
fear, leaped forward. The barrier flashed past
his nose and he leaped into full stride, two full
lengths in the lead of the field before the others
were under way.</p>

<p>Big Jim Long, his florid face mottled, hurled
his chewed cigar against the ground and swore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
viciously. Sword of Gideon, running like a wild
horse, opened up a gap of eight lengths between
himself and the nearest pursuer in the first
eighth of a mile. In vain Attorney Jackson’s
jockey, remembering his instructions, spurred
and urged his mount, striving to catch the flying
leader and set the pace. At the half Attorney
Jackson dropped back, beaten and out of it.
Mildred Rogers’ rider, seeing the conspiracy going
wrong, made a desperate effort to overtake
the flying Sword. The nitroglycerine pellet had
acted and the aged horse was running as he had
run when he seemed destined to be champion.
Length by length he increased his lead over the
staggering, wabbling field, and tore down the
stretch fifteen lengths ahead of Patsy Frewen.</p>

<p>Big Jim Long, his heavy jaws sagging, his face
mottled red and white, his big, soft hands
clenched, watched until the horses were within
a few yards of the finish. Then he turned and
walked rapidly across through the edge of the
betting ring toward the exit. At the back of
the betting ring he met Hardshell Gaines moving
toward the paddock to greet the victorious
Sword of Gideon. Big Jim’s pent up wrath
exploded.</p>

<p>“You—and your blank blanked spavined
hound!” he raged. “You blanked old fool, if it
hadn’t been for you—”</p>

<p>Hardshell Gaines looked straight ahead, unseeing,
unhearing, and as he walked past the
furious gambler he hummed contentedly; and
even Big Jim recognized the long metre doxology.</p>

</div>


<p>There remains some of the Christ-spirit in the
worst of us, perhaps, but the most optimistic of
missionaries would hardly have assayed the soul
of “Jaundice” O’Keefe with the hope of discovering
even a trace of that quality. Jaundice
was a product, or by-product, of the race-track.
He had run away from his home in St. Louis at
the age of eleven, to escape the beatings administered
by a drinking father and a sodden mother,
and had found refuge in a freight car loaded
with horses which were being shipped to a race-meeting
in New Orleans. Two hostlers were
drinking from a bottle when not sleeping on a
pile of hay. They welcomed the boy, gave him a
drink, fed him, and allowed him to burrow into
the hay for warmth. Perhaps it was kindness,
perhaps they saw in him a means of escaping
the work of feeding and watering horses during
the long journey.</p>

<p>Jaundice was happy. He loved horses. Perhaps
that was the remaining trace of good after
the rest had been bred or beaten out of him. He
had loved the horses which drew the coal wagon
his father drove when sober, and the sight of the
trim thoroughbreds filled him with awed admiration.
Arrived in New Orleans, he followed the
horses to the race-track, found refuge in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
stables, and was adopted into the army of those
who follow the races. A year later he had acquired
a master’s degree in profanity and
obscenity and developed a ratlike viciousness in
fighting when cornered. He was undersized and
undernourished, with the remnants of a fighting
spirit from generations of Irish sustaining him.
Stable-boys learned to fear the savageness of his
methods and left him alone. Occasionally a
trainer or stable boss beat him with a whip and
cursed him.</p>

<p>Instinctively horses loved him. In one year
he was an exercise boy. At fourteen, with all
the wickedness and viciousness of the race-track
and stable concentrated in him, he could ride
and was awarded a jockey’s license and a suit of
gay-colored silks.</p>

<p>He rode winners. Winning, with Jaundice,
was unselfish. He rode not for personal glory
or for money, but for the honor of the horse on
which he was mounted. When he was beaten he
gulped dry sobs and went away with his mount
to console it.</p>

<p>For four years he rode races on the flat, at
tracks all over America. During these four
years he made as much money as the average
man makes in a lifetime, and at the end of it
had nothing. To him money meant only expensive
meals, clothes remarkable for colors and
patterns, wine, women of a sort, and large yellow
diamonds. At eighteen he was an old man. His
face was yellow and drawn; he had ceased to be
“Kid” O’Keefe and become “Jaundice.” He
was gaining weight and beginning to pay the
penalty of the carouses which followed each temporary
period of prosperity. For a year he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
fought to hold his standing. His mounts became
fewer and fewer. When the owners ceased to
employ him to ride on the flat, he became a
steeplechase jockey.</p>

<p>Riding steeplechasers in races means in the
majority of cases moral and physical suicide.
Jaundice had no fear of physical consequence,
nor any conception of morality. With two
drinks of whisky poured into his outraged body,
he would have tried to make his mount jump
the Grand Cañon, had the course led in that
direction. Falls and broken bones failed to
break his nerve, but his subconscious honesty
was shattered. On the flat he never had ridden
a crooked race. He was restrained by no consciousness
of right or wrong. He tried always
to win because he loved the horses he rode. Over
the jumps he had no such scruples. The steeplechase
horses were “has-beens” like himself and
entitled to no consideration. He commenced to
ride queer-looking races. He was nineteen when
he fell off the favorite in a steeplechase race to
permit an outsider to win and the stewards ruled
him off the tracks for one year.</p>

<p>What Jaundice did in that year of banishment
he alone knew in detail. Barred from the only
home and the only associates he had ever known,
the great loneliness came upon him. He was
broke. He stole and was sent to prison. When
the suspension was lifted he went back to the
tracks. He had grown heavier and his eyes and
his mind were blurred by drink. He lived with
the horses, attaching himself to the stable for
which he had been a star jockey, and lived in
the stalls and the cars. His love of the animals
themselves had waned. Drudgery and vicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
living had warped even that instinct. When he
dared he became a tout, whispering information
to petty gamblers at the edge of the betting ring.
When he left the tracks at night it was to betray
stable information to bartenders in return for
drinks.</p>

<p>When he was twenty-two there remained two
loves by which it was proved that all good can
not be smelted out of a human being. One was
for Doc Grausman, the gallant bay stake horse
of the stable, whose dam he had ridden to victory
many times. The other was for Lord James.</p>

<p>On race-tracks there is something in a name.
Jaundice received his because his complexion
had become a dirty yellow. Lord James was so
called because the one spark of decency remaining
in him caused him to conceal his family
name. It was reputed that he was the son of an
English nobleman and that he could have a title
and estate if he returned to England. Rags of
an old pride and remnants of decent breeding
restrained Lord James from mentioning the family
name as his own or from returning home to
disgrace them. He had come to America, a
younger son, with a stable of race-horses and
high hopes. Robbed, fleeced, he had “quit.”
Jaundice can not be spoken of as having degenerated.
His original height permitted but a
slight fall. But Lord James had sunk to even
lower levels. He was a cadger, a tout, and a
sneak-thief at such times when no risk was
involved.</p>

<p>No one around the tracks hated either Lord
James or Jaundice. They pitied Jaundice, but
the touts themselves despised Lord James. He
had lost all his courage, if he ever possessed any,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and drink had sapped his health and his brain.
Of the trio, only Doc Grausman bore his name
honestly. His names were those of his sire and
his granddam, and he was of royal blood and
three years old.</p>

<p>When Lord James and Jaundice had become
friends no one knew. Probably it was during
Jaundice’s career as a winning jockey, while he
scattered money recklessly after every winning
race. Upon such boys Lord James had preyed
for years. These two had nothing in common.
Race, religion, birth, breeding, and education
made them different, but they met in the thick
scum of vice and became inseparable. For Lord
James, Jaundice stole and betrayed stable secrets,
pulled race-horses, bought drinks, and furnished
food and lodging. It is not recorded that
Lord James ever did anything for Jaundice.</p>

<p>These two sank lower and lower together.
When the majority of the race-tracks of the
country were closed, they disappeared from the
world of sport, starved, and served prison terms
together. When racing reopened, they reappeared.
Jaundice had developed a cough. His
wasted body revealed the ravages of tuberculosis.
Lord James was wearing, with a pitiful effort to
maintain an air of decency, a suit purchased
with his last remittance money two years before.</p>

<p>The horses were racing at Jamaica and the
weather was raw and rainy. They experienced
difficulty in gaining an entry to the track and
were compelled to remain outside, shivering and
wet, until the day’s sport ended. Then a negro
stable-boy allowed them to sleep with him in a
stall, and Jaundice procured food from the
camp-fires, where no one ever is refused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Lord James did not get up the next morning.
He had crawled into the hay with wet clothing
and in the morning he had a fever. Jaundice
brought him food, but he did not eat. All day
he remained huddled in the hay, covered with
horse blankets, his face turned to the board wall.
He was thinking and his mind was Gethsemane.</p>

<p>During the night Lord James touched Jaundice
with his hand and waked him. Very
quietly and with a return of long-forgotten dignity,
he entrusted to Jaundice an envelope upon
which was written an address in England,
charging him to mail it and allow no one to see
it. He asked Jaundice to see the boys and ask
them to bury him decently. Then he gripped
Jaundice’s hand and died gamely, sustained by
the traditions of his race and class. Jaundice
alone wept. It was the first time in many years
he had wept, and he was ashamed of his tears.</p>

<p>Around the race-track no man connected with
the game dies and lacks a decent funeral, but
there was scant sympathy for Lord James. The
hat was passed, bookmakers, jockeys, trainers,
owners, grafters, even the pickpockets, contributing,
but their contributions were small. The
whole amounted to eighty dollars. Jaundice
was not satisfied. Had he been satisfied, there
would have been no story to tell.</p>

<p>On the day following the horses moved to
Belmont Park to open the racing season on that
track, and Doc Grausman was entered to start
in a high-weight handicap. Doc Grausman belonged
to a wealthy man whose colors Jaundice
had often carried to victory. This owner had
not entered the horse in the handicap with any
expectation of winning. The colt needed work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
and he wanted to see how well the three-year-old
could carry weight racing against all aged
horses.</p>

<p>Jaundice had not slept. His clothing still
was damp and he was coughing. For the time
his abiding love for Doc Grausman was put in
the background while he went from man to man
begging money to give Lord James what he considered
a proper and fitting funeral. The undertaker
wanted one hundred and fifty dollars.
Jaundice was determined to raise the sum before
the afternoon’s sport ended.</p>

<p>Shortly before the bugle sounded, calling the
horses from the paddock for the first race, a
fractious colt lashed out with his feet and kicked
the jockey who had been employed to ride Doc
Grausman in the fourth. Jaundice heard of the
accident within a few minutes. It was he who
hurried to the club-house and informed the
owner.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Jaundice,” the owner said carelessly.
“I wanted the colt to have the workout.
Now, I suppose I’ll have to scratch him. I don’t
want to put a strange boy up.”</p>

<p>“Mister Phil,” said Jaundice, inspired with
a sudden idea, “let me ride Doc Grausman.
I’m down to weight, Mister Phil. I only weigh
a hundred and twenty-eight now. Let me ride
him, Mister Phil, and I’ll win.”</p>

<p>His voice was pleading, his eyes and manner
appealing, and he coughed harder. The owner
was surprised and laughed slightly. “I’m
afraid it can not be fixed, Jaundice,” he said
lightly. “How do you stand with the stewards?”</p>

<p>“I’m clean with them now, Mister Phil. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
ain’t got nothin’ on me. They never could
prove I pulled Lady Rose. I’m down to weight,
Mister Phil, and that Doc Grausman horse likes
me.”</p>

<p>His eagerness and the truth of the final statement
decided the matter.</p>

<p>“I’ll see the stewards and explain,” said the
owner. “He’s only in for the workout, and
perhaps they’ll stand for it. Sure you’re strong
enough to handle the colt?”</p>

<p>The owner had observed the cough, and Jaundice
checked it with an effort.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mister Phil, I’m all right. Just caught
a cold. Get this mount for me, Mister Phil.
I’ve got to plant Lord James decent.”</p>

<p>“That old bum dead at last?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ve got to get a hundred and
fifty to plant him, and the boys ain’t kicking in
fast. Let me ride this Doc Grausman hoss and
I’ll plant Lord James swell, like his family
would want him.”</p>

<p>The owner passed over a twenty-dollar banknote.
What he told the track officials no one
knows, but when the fourth race was called,
Jaundice, carefully hiding his cough, rode forth
for the first time in four years wearing the colors
of his old stable.</p>

<p>The bookmakers were laying thirty to one
against Doc Grausman, and a wit in the ring
said it was ten to one the colt, twenty to one
the boy. What was not known was that Jaundice
had taken the money that had been contributed
to bury Lord James and wagered it three
ways, straight, place, and show, on Doc Grausman.
A new generation of jockeys faced the
start, a generation that knew nothing of the skill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of the boy who had ridden champions. The
new boys, with the contempt that youth holds
for the “has-been,” jeered at Jaundice, and
hurled insulting epithets at him as they wheeled
and maneuvered for the advantage of the
break. Jaundice did not retort with oaths and
vilifications as he would have done in other
days. He was afraid he would start to
cough.</p>

<p>The barrier flashed. Jaundice had been holding
Doc Grausman steady during the milling of
the others. Out of the corner of the eye he
had caught the betraying arm movement of the
starter an instant before the barrier flashed upward,
had shot Doc Grausman at the starting
line just the instant it flickered past his nose,
had beaten the start a length and a half while
the others were taking the first jump and sent
him roaring down the long straight-away for
four and a half furlongs. Riding him out desperately
at the end, he held the lead by half a
length over the favorite.</p>

<p>As the horses paraded back past the stands,
he held his lips tightly pressed together. He
staggered a little as he weighed out, and in the
paddock his lips were reddened. The strain of
the ride had opened the old wounds in his lungs.</p>

<p>An hour later he ordered the undertaker to
give Lord James the best funeral he could for
one thousand two hundred dollars and paid over
the money. There remained for his share of
the victory just twenty-seven dollars.</p>

<p>The news spread around the track that evening
that Jaundice was to give Lord James a
“swell funeral.” Curiosity was aroused. Touts,
stable-boys, bookmakers’ helpers, a few jockeys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
attended. It happened that Jaundice came to
me to consult as to the minister, and I had
secured the services of a wonderful little rector
who is much interested in all human beings.</p>

<p>The funeral was the strangest one I ever attended.
The little minister was doing his best
to comfort the mourners, but plainly was at a
disadvantage because Jaundice was the only
mourner. Jaundice, through some instinctive
sense of respect for the dead, was standing very
awkwardly and tears were rolling down his
cheeks. He was weeping for the second time in
his life. Finally the little rector read from
the service: “He is not dead, but sleeping.”</p>

<p>Jaundice started, then stared, reached instinctively
for his pocket, and sobbed in a whisper:
“Ten dollars will win you twenty-seven if you
think old Lord James is only sleeping.”</p>

<p>His reversion to instinct raised a laugh. For
the first time the assemblage was getting its
money’s worth. The little rector was very much
shocked. He could not understand that Jaundice
meant no disrespect. He argued that no
man could live in the United States and be so
completely ignorant of religion. I said that
Jaundice thought Jesus Christ was a cuss word
and that his only knowledge that he possessed
an immortal soul was from hearing it God
damned by trainers and others.</p>

<p>A week later I heard that Jaundice was in
a Brooklyn hospital and in bad shape. I went
to see him to get for a newspaper the story of
a jockey who, while sick to death, rode in a race
to win money enough to bury a friend. He was
propped up in bed, coughing. The doctor had
told me he had but a little time to live. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
was glad to see me and inquired how I liked
Lord James’ funeral.</p>

<p>“Great class to that, Jaundice; best I ever
attended.”</p>

<p>“No one can’t say that I piked,” he responded,
beaming at the praise. “I planted
Lord James swell, and his folks can’t ever say
I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You’re looking better,” I lied. “Be back
on the track pretty soon?”</p>

<p>“Lord James won’t beat me more than a
neck,” he said without emotion. “Something
busted inside me during that race. Have you
heard how Doc Grausman is comin’ along? He
sure ought to win that stake this week.”</p>

<p>Presently he spoke of the little rector. “What
do you think of that guy?” he asked, rather
contemptuous of the ignorance of the minister.
“He thought Lord James was only sleeping,
but he wouldn’t back his opinion with coin.”</p>

<p>I strove to explain, without much success.</p>

<p>“That little guy is all right,” said Jaundice.
“Did you hear what he said about Lord James
havin’ a chanst on that track he was talking
about? Say, Lord James has about as much
chanst as I have.”</p>

<p>“Everyone has a chance,” I said feebly.</p>

<p>“Me?” he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“Sure; the Book says everyone has who repents.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got nothin’ to repent of exceptin’
pullin’ three or four of them bum chasers. The
stewards couldn’t get nothin’ on me at that.”</p>

<p>“The Judges up there know it all.”</p>

<p>“Know everything? Then, say, what chanst
has a guy got?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>As a religious prospect the case was too hard,
so I telephoned the little rector and gave it
over to him. He called upon Jaundice several
times, and the following week I went to the hospital
again. Jaundice was weak but smiling.</p>

<p>“Say,” he whispered hoarsely, “I got a
chanst. That little man says that them Judges
up there knows I was carryin’ too much weight
to run true and that you can’t blame anyone
for losin’ when he is handicapped out of it. I
told him about pulling them chasers and lyin’
and stealin’, and he said that didn’t make no
difference, that the Judges don’t set a guy down
forever if he is sorry he done wrong.” He remained
thinking for a time.</p>

<p>“He didn’t have to tell me to be sorry,” he
whispered. “Honest, I always was sorry when
I pulled one of them bum chasers when he was
trying. It wasn’t square to the horse. This
is the softest bet I ever had,” he whispered.
“I’m going to play it. Them’s good odds—a
chanst to win all them things he told me about
and only be sorry. It’s like writing your own
ticket.”</p>

<p>I found the little rector very thoughtful and
amazed at this new manner of man he had discovered,
and when he buried Jaundice the next
week he got right down among us and talked
about handicaps and weights, and keeping on
trying all the time. He talked just as if he had
been in the paddock half his life, and the last
thing he said was: “If I were a bookie, I’d
lay odds that Jaundice cashes that last bet.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TOUTIN’ MISTAH FOX</h2>
</div>


<p>Prosias Trimble’s protuberant lower lip
drooped dejectedly, his eyes shifted in a scowl
until the pupils were dots in the corners of
expanses of white, his russet shoes, rapier-pointed
and uncomfortably overcrowded with
feet, dragged laggingly along the marble floor
of the St. Charles Hotel Turkish baths. He
went about his task of distributing towels with
the air of one who has suffered great wrong.</p>

<p>In the private rooms and on cots ranged in
the dormitory, white men snored, gurgled,
choked, strangled. The sounds of sixty fat men
snoring in sixty keys filled the rooms. Even
the snore of the man in room six, which was
a combination of shifting gears, a cut-out muffler,
and a slipping clutch, passed unheard by
“Pro.” Even the cheery whistle of his fellow
rubber was unnoticed. The world was a place
of darkness, and Pro’s mood was two shades
darker than his skin, the color scheme of which
was that of the ace of spades.</p>

<p>It was a dull night. The St. Charles Hotel
Turkish baths were but half filled with patrons,
although overcrowded with snores. The light
patronage and the dejected mood of Prosias
were due to the same cause: the winter meeting
at the Fair Grounds race-track in New Orleans
had ended two days before, the army of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and horses that had encamped in the Crescent
City during the winter, and the swarm of plump
patrons which nightly had crowded the St.
Charles, had moved northward to Baltimore,
and Prosias Trimble, top sergeant in that army,
with the rank of tout, was left behind, to eke
out a livelihood by working as rubber in the
bath-house. The pearl-colored spats, the pointed
russet shoes, the fawn waistcoat checkerboarded
in green, the massive watch-chain draped in two
graceful curves from buttonhole to pockets, the
four-carat near-diamond which glistened with
fading brilliancy in the purple necktie, were of
the vanities vain: the “hosses” were gone, and
Pro, compelled to return to the profession he
had disowned when he became a race-follower,
was not with them.</p>

<p>Two days before this night of gloom Prosias
had strutted the streets of New Orleans—the
envy of colored men, the admired of many colored
women. His shining countenance, which
reflected joy and happiness, had added color to
the throngs in paddock and betting ring. In
the evenings his presence had graced social affairs
of the negro eight hundred, and Miss Luck
had smiled consistently upon him. He had
spent three evenings bidding farewell to the
friends he had accumulated during the winter,
had lightly promised half a dozen of his newly
acquired lady friends to see them when the
horses came back, and had created envy and
dark hatred among the men by the casual carelessness
with which he bade them polite farewells
and expressed hopes of seeing them at
Baltimore or Louisville or even at Saratoga during
the meetings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Until the morning of “Get Away Day” Miss
Luck had smiled, and on that morning she
beamed. Prosias and his bankroll had prospered,
waxed fat, and flourished. The customary
rumors had circulated on that morning—the old,
old story of the “Get Away Killing” and the
feed man’s bill—and straight from the oats-box
the rumor had come to Pro, alighted upon him,
and stung him. It was a hot tip—so hot that
it singed and burned. The tip was to the effect
that Centerdrink had been nominated to win—that
he was to be shooed in at long odds, and
that all the grievances of the bettors against the
bookmakers were to be evened up in one great
killing.</p>

<p>Pro had it from a jockey, who had it right
out of the conference at which Centerdrink had
been chosen to win. Pro had hurled his bankroll—the
fortune accumulated during the entire
winter—at the bookmakers, who, instead of
breaking in panic, had handed him back smiles
and bits of pasteboard with cabalistic charcoal
characters on them. Pro had stood to win more
than twelve thousand dollars—and he had stood
dazedly while he watched Centerdrink finish
eighth. When the truth dawned upon his benumbed
brain he had reached one hand into
the now vacant pocket, seeking car-fare, and,
finding it not, had sought the bath-house and
work—his dream of a summer jaunt around the
race-courses wrecked.</p>

<p>Pro completed his task of distributing towels
and stood thinking. Daylight was commencing
to show through the little windows just under
the ceiling of the bath-house, and daylight
brought with it fresh, bitter thoughts. He knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
that a few hundred miles to the northward the
sun was rising on a stretch of level land, a circular
ribbon of loam laid upon a field of green.
Birds were singing in the trees, meadow larks
were rising from the infield. Rows of fires were
springing up along the front of the circular line
of low, whitewashed stables. Slender, graceful
horses, blanketed to the knees, were being led
around and around in little circles, the odor
of frying bacon was in the air, the rhythmic
drumming of the feet of a speedy colt was
sounding from the track. Far across the velvet
infield, near where the spidery pillars of the
stand stood black against the lightening sky,
men with watches in their hands were on the
rail, timing in fractions of seconds the movements
of the flying colt. He pictured one vacant
spot on the pickets of the fence—a spot which,
but for the fickleness of Miss Luck and the hot
tip on Centerdrink, he would have been occupying.</p>

<p>Slowly a light broke over his face—as sun
striving to shine through thunder clouds.</p>

<p>“Reckon as how maybe Ah’ll be dar yit,” he
muttered to himself. “Mist’ Jim Robin he say
to me yistaddy mahnin’: ‘Pro, yuh wuthless
niggah, gimme good rub dis mahnin’ an’ when
Ah gits to Baltimo’ Ah’ll sen’ yoh a good thing.’
Yassah, dat ’zackly what he done say, an’ Ah
done rub him till he yell ’nuff. Mist’ Jim Robin
he done keep his promise. He’ll sen’ me
dat good thing, den Ah’ll show dese Noo ’Leans
shines a classy niggah. Ah’ll ride in Mistah
Pullman’s cahr ’stid o’ Mistah Burton’s cahr—nothward.
Yassah.”</p>

<p>Visibly affected by a process of triumph of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
mind over condition, Pro achieved a more cheerful
countenance. The happy smile which was
his trademark, and the ingratiating grin which
made him welcome among race-track followers,
returned by degrees, and by the time the snorers
aroused themselves and shuddered at the cold
plunge before coming to the rubbing tables his
ready laugh and the seductive manner in which
he wielded the solicitous whisk-broom upon each
departing guest won reward.</p>

<p>“Um-um, Miss Luck comin’ back,” he muttered
hopefully, as he counted his tips. “Um-um.
Dis niggah in Baltimo’ foah Sattaday
suah—jes’ in time foh to see de handicap.
Wisht Mist’ Jim’d sen’ me dat tip he done
promise me.”</p>

<p>As if in answer to the wish, the page in the
hotel under which the St. Charles baths are located
was passing through lobbies and writing-rooms
paging:</p>

<p>“Mistah Prosias Trimble! Mistah Prosias
Trimble!”</p>

<p>“Hyah, boy,” the captain of the bell-boys
called. “Doan’ be a-pagin’ dat name ’roun’ de
house. Prosias Trimble he dat buxom black
niggah Pro, down in de baf-house.”</p>

<p>“Tellygraft foh yoh, niggah,” the page announced
disgustedly, as he tossed the yellow
envelope toward Pro and abandoned all hope
of a tip.</p>

<p>“Miss Luck, favor me!” Pro pleaded devoutly
as he held the envelope in his hand. “Miss
Luck, bring de good news—doan’ betray me
now. Ah needs yoh!”</p>

<p>“What does he say, Pro?”</p>

<p>“What who say?” demanded Pro, his lips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
suddenly bulging outward belligerently, as he
swung about to face Mr. Clarence Fox, who had
pursued the telegram from the lobby down into
the bath-house.</p>

<p>“What Mist’ Jim Robin say?” responded Mr.
Fox, scowling.</p>

<p>“How come yoh knows so much?”</p>

<p>“Reckon Ah doan’ know he promise’ you a
tip?”</p>

<p>“How come yoh knows?”</p>

<p>“Reckon yoh didn’t infohm a certain lady
frien’ o’ mine?”</p>

<p>“Dat yaller gal too brash wif her mouf!”
Pro muttered regretfully, as he recalled the fact
that the lady in question was manicurist in the
Royal Crescent Palace barber shop, Clarence
Fox owner.</p>

<p>In spite of his appearance of displeasure, Pro
was not displeased. His mind was working, and
Mr. Fox was included in the thoughts. Mr. Fox
possessed money. Pro’s cash capital consisted
of the two dollars and twenty cents secured in
tips during the night’s work. Further, he was
aware that in order to turn even a sure thing
on a race tip into money, working capital is
required. His acquaintance with Mr. Clarence
Fox had been incidental to his friendship for
Miss Susie, the manicurist, and Pro recalled,
with some regret, the fact that during the more
prosperous times of the winter he had been inclined
to treat Clarence Fox condescendingly.
But Mr. Fox, proprietor of the five-chair barber
shop catering to the swelldom of the negro district,
he viewed in a different light now. If Mr.
Fox could be persuaded to finance certain illegal
but delectable operations, Pro saw a way to overcome
lack of working capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“’Scuse me, Mistah Fox, if Ah seem discurtous,”
he said, “but a gennelman gotta be
careful when he gits straight tips from gennelman
white owners.”</p>

<p>“Dat all right, Mistah Trimble,” said Clarence,
responding to politeness with greater politeness.
“Ah respects yoh sentiments. Reckon
dat a wahm tip?”</p>

<p>“Ah ’low she ’bout ninety-eight in de shade,”
Pro responded.</p>

<p>“Ah doan’ ’low dat yoh ’tends to bet enuff
foh to cover all de han’-books in Noo ’Leans?”
Clarence inquired flatteringly.</p>

<p>“Don’t ’low as Ah can,” said Pro regretfully.
“You ’low ef Ah tell yoh wha’ hoss Mist’ Jim
done name’, kin yoh wait till Ah gits my bets
down, so’s not influence de odds?”</p>

<p>“Ah ’low dat Ah kin. Yoh ’low dat tip look
good?”</p>

<p>“Look good?” Pro’s voice quivered with outraged
indignation. “Yoh ’low Mist’ Jim done
tellygraft a niggah lessen it good?”</p>

<p>“Nevah kin tell,” commented Mr. Fox cynically.</p>

<p>Prosias hesitated. His mind was in panic for
fear of losing the opportunity to secure working
capital, yet the situation was embarrassing. He
found it difficult to approach a business proposition
without revealing the fact that he was
embarrassed financially.</p>

<p>“Reckon yoh do the right thing if Ah tell
yoh de name ob de hoss?” he said tentatively.</p>

<p>“Yoh knows me, Pro. Ah always does de
right thing, doan’ Ah?”</p>

<p>“Dat yoh repitation, Clarence,” said Pro,
vaguely conscious of the fact that he knew
nothing of Clarence’s reputation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Always aims to do de right thing, Pro.”</p>

<p>“Hyah she go, den,” said Pro, with sudden
determination, as he tore open the envelope.</p>

<p>“Miss Luck, be mine!” he breathed, as he
unfolded the yellow paper. With Mr. Fox
craning his neck to see over his shoulder, he
read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Shoot the roll on the filly in the fourth.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright">ROBIN.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Fox wrinkled the end of his broad nose
and looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“De roll on de filly!” said Prosias, his eyes
rolling.</p>

<p>“Wha’ hoss he mean?” inquired the less informed
Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>“Wha’ hoss?” Pro repeated disdainfully.
“Why, dat Ivory Gahter filly, dat who: Mist’
Jim’s filly, an’ she good. She ripe, niggah, she
win suah, an’ de odds—um-um! Niggah, we
rich!”</p>

<p>“Ivory Gahter—I’m gwine!” exclaimed Mr.
Fox excitedly. “Niggah, yoh play de books
’roun’ hyar. Ah’ll slaughtah dem Rampaht
Street gamblahs.”</p>

<p>The convinced Mr. Fox, hesitating at the barber
shop only long enough to sweep the till clean,
dashed toward Rampart Street, while Pro, waiting
until his financial backer disappeared,
ascended to the second story of the pool-room
nearest the hotel, and, after considerable haggling,
persuaded the handbook keeper to wager
twenty dollars against two against the chances
of Ivory Garter’s winning. Pro mourned because
he knew that at the track the odds would
be twenty to one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Instead of retiring for the day, Pro promenaded,
ostensibly for pleasure, but always with
a view of borrowing capital to wager. Several
times he tentatively opened negotiations, but,
meeting with scant encouragement, he contented
himself with remarking airily that he had remained
in New Orleans to consummate a betting
commission for an owner, and was leaving to
join the horses that evening, after the killing.</p>

<p>His probably were the first eyes to read the
ticker that afternoon, when in jerks and clicks
the tape recorded the fact that Ivory Garter had
won. Thirty minutes later, with twenty-two
dollars in his pocket, Pro entered the bath-house.</p>

<p>“Ah’s sorry to be ’bliged to notify yoh Ah
resigns,” he announced. “Ah’s called No’th.”</p>

<p>With light heart and faith in Miss Luck restored,
he went forth to the Royal Crescent
Palace barber shop by a devious route. At his
first stop he remarked casually that he wouldn’t
be surprised if he and Mr. Fox had cleaned up
five hundred dollars, at the second stop he
opined he and Mr. Fox had won seven hundred,
and by the time he reached Canal Street his
estimate of probable winnings had passed twelve
hundred dollars and his cash capital had dwindled
to eight dollars, due to sudden generosity
in lending and to purchasing cigars for less
fortunate acquaintances.</p>

<p>His mental estimate of the amount won exceeded
the figures he dared express openly.
There was no limit to his imagination. Mr. Fox
had money. A hundred dollars should yield
fifteen hundred at proper pool-room odds. Mr.
Fox rated himself a sport. Pro calculated that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
a proper sport, with money, would bet at least
five hundred dollars on a tip straight from an
owner, which at twelve to one—the lowest possible
odds he figured Mr. Fox would accept—would
be six thousand dollars, fifty per cent of
which was three thousand dollars. Pro pictured
himself riding into the track at Baltimore in
an open automobile. He even determined to
pay admission instead of soliciting an employee’s
badge.</p>

<p>He reached the Royal Crescent Palace barber
shop in a state of excited anticipation. Mr. Fox,
at ease, was draped over the cigar counter, and
his very nonchalant calmness sent a shiver
through Pro’s optimism.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Clarence?” he exclaimed, under
forced draught. “We suah slip dat one over!”</p>

<p>“Suah did,” assented Mr. Fox, without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“We ’mos’ ruin dis hyah town, Ah reckon,”
observed Pro, inviting information. “Ah suah
clean mah end.”</p>

<p>“Ah’s glad yoh hit ’em hahd, Pro,” said Mr.
Fox, without warming. “Ah wah jest a-wishin’
Ah done had ez much faith in yoh frien’ ez
yoh did.”</p>

<p>“How come, Clarence?” asked Pro, with a
sudden sinking suspicion. “Didn’ yoh plunge?”</p>

<p>“Hadn’ no faith a-tall,” asserted Clarence.</p>

<p>“Didn’ yoh win <i>nothin’</i>?” asked Pro, unbelief,
suspicion, crushed hopes, all concentrated
in his voice.</p>

<p>“Jes’ li’l’ pikin’ bet, Pro,” said Mr. Fox resignedly.
“Ah bin kickin’ mahsef. Ah mought
a-win ’nuff to be goin’ norf wif yoh. But Ah
lack faith. Ah lack faith perdigious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Yoh win nuffin a-tall?” Pro reiterated, his
voice expressing his ebbing hope.</p>

<p>“Ah win jes’ twenty dollah,” said Mr. Fox
positively. “Niggah on’y lay me ten to one,
an’ Ah bet on’y two dollah.”</p>

<p>He hesitated, waiting as if expecting passionate
contradiction, and added:</p>

<p>“Hyah yoh bit foh de tip.”</p>

<p>He peeled a five-dollar bill from a huge roll
extracted carelessly from a trousers pocket and
flipped it toward Pro.</p>

<p>“Dat a good tip, Pro,” he said in conciliatory
tones. “Ah thanks yoh foh it. Wish Ah’d
had moah faith. Ef yoh git any good ones in
Baltimo’, wiah me.”</p>

<p>Prosias, speechless, pocketed the bill and
turned. At the door he paused.</p>

<p>“Yas, sah, Clarence,” he said slowly. “Ah
ain’ done fohgit. Ah’ll ’membah yoh, Clarence.”</p>

<p>His brain was dazed, but his heart seethed
with bitter resentment. He knew that Clarence
Fox had profited largely and had swindled him
out of his just share. He walked slowly, bitterly
regretting the generosity of the morning,
but for which he still would have had enough
money to reach the race-track. He went humbly
back to the St. Charles baths and petitioned to
be restored to his position. That night, while
working upon the super-fattened carcasses of
patrons, thoughts of Clarence Fox and his perfidy
came to his mind, and he struck hard, eliciting
howls of protest. And during that long
night his brain slowly evolved a plan of vengeance.</p>

<p>Three days later Clarence Fox, arrayed in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
glory which neither Solomon nor the lilies ever
could have rivaled, descended into the St.
Charles baths.</p>

<p>“Why, howdy, Pro?” he exclaimed, with well
simulated surprise. “Ah thought yoh done
gone Baltimo’.”</p>

<p>“Not yit, Clarence, not yit.”</p>

<p>His cheerful aspect and his failure to express
either anger or sorrow puzzled Clarence.</p>

<p>“How come?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Frien’ ast me would Ah remain foh a few
days an’ ack ez his bettin’ c’missioner.”</p>

<p>“Whafoh of a frien’?”</p>

<p>“Same frien’ ez sen’ me that last tip.”</p>

<p>Clarence Fox’s manner changed with startling
suddenness. From a patronizing familiarity
and superior condescension, he descended
instantly to solicitous friendship.</p>

<p>“Hear anythin’?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Ain’ ’spectin’ anythin’ foh a day er two.”</p>

<p>“Gwine tell me when he wiahs yoh, Pro?”</p>

<p>“Ain’ slippin’ no tips to niggahs da won’
bet no coin.” Pro’s contempt was impersonal.</p>

<p>“Ah’s a bettin’ fool when Ah got faith,”
asserted Mr. Fox earnestly, fitting the shoe
to himself. “Las’ time Ah ain’ got no faith
a-tall.”</p>

<p>“Reckon maybe yoh won’ hab no faith dis
hyah time,” Pro remarked disinterestedly. “Ah
sabes mah tips foh gamblahs, not pikahs.”</p>

<p>The term stung, but Mr. Fox, while writhing
under the insult, chose to pretend dignity and
ignored it.</p>

<p>“Ah ain’ int’rusted in five-dollah bettahs,”
Pro added, rubbing salt into the hurt.</p>

<p>“Five dollah?” Mr. Fox exclaimed indignantly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
“Pro, when Ah’s got faith Ah bets five
hundred dollah.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so,” Pro commented in unconvinced
accents. “Wha’ dat git me?”</p>

<p>“Dat,” asserted Mr. Fox, with emphasis, “git
yoh twenty-fibe pussent ob all Ah wins.”</p>

<p>“Ah ain’ int’rusted,” said Pro, proceeding
about his duties with an air of finality.</p>

<p>“Lissen at reason, Pro,” Mr. Fox argued in
quick alarm. “Twenty-fibe am mah reg’lar pussent,
but ’tween frien’s lak yoh an’ me, it’s
forty pussent.”</p>

<p>“Fifty neahrer right,” commented Pro, still
busy.</p>

<p>“Fifty an’ me takin’ all de chanst? Fohty
am gen’rous.”</p>

<p>“An’ show me de tickets?” Pro’s tone was
an ultimatum.</p>

<p>“Doan yoh trus’ me, Pro?” Mr. Fox registered
indignant surprise.</p>

<p>“Suah Ah trust yoh, Clarence,” said Pro
sulkily. “Didn’t yoh han’ me fibe dollah last
time?”</p>

<p>“Dat mah reg’lar twenty-fibe pussent,” responded
Mr. Fox humbly, choosing to ignore
the insinuation. “It fohty dis time.”</p>

<p>“Undah dem circumstances, Clarence, Ah’m
int’rusted,” said Pro. “Ah’m expectin’ de
glad tidin’s ’bout day aftah to-morrah.”</p>

<p>“Lemme know, Pro?”</p>

<p>“Yas, sah, Clarence, Ah suah let you know,”
Pro promised. And, as Mr. Clarence Fox departed,
Pro, leaning upon the handle of a mop,
suddenly commenced a jellylike flesh quake
which concluded with a noisy irruption of
laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Dat niggah done broke!” he muttered, as
his inward merriment subsided. “Dat niggah
broke right now, on’y he doan’ know it.”</p>

<p>His plot was working.</p>

<p>That evening he sat in the bath-house, his
mind concentrated upon the racing form. He
was busy picking losers, instead of winners, and
even the unmuffled snores of the sleepers failed
to distract his attention.</p>

<p>“Kunnel Campbell,” he read and considered.
“Dat de dog what run las’ foah times at de
Fair Groun’s. He run las’ foah times, he seben
dat othah time. Dat colt ain’t got no chanst
a-tall.” He studied the entries for a moment.</p>

<p>“Kunnel Campbell,” he repeated. “Dat mah
s’lection foh Mistah Fox in de fust race.”</p>

<p>He yelled with inward laughter for a moment
and resumed his work on the dope sheet.</p>

<p>“Jakmino,” he read. “Jakmino. He dat
skate dat Mist’ Jim call de buggy hoss. Dat
hoss got bow tendons, glandahs, an’ de boll
weevil. He kain’t run fast ’nuff foh to wahm
hisse’f good. He ain’t no runnin’ hoss. He ain’
fas ’nuff foh to pull a disc harrer.” He muttered
over the form sheet a moment, then decided.
“Jakmino—dat mah s’lection foh Mistah
Fox in de third race.”</p>

<p>Prosias went off into another spasm of inward
mirth.</p>

<p>He studied the entries for the last race, suddenly
threw back his head and laughed until
the snorers, disturbed, ceased snoring and
turned over off their backs.</p>

<p>“Irene W.,” he said, and laughed again.
“Irene W.—dat hoss suah a houn’—wust houn’
on de circuit. She six yeah ole an’ a maiden—ain’t
nebber bin in de money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>He laughed until near apoplexy and chuckled
to himself.</p>

<p>“Irene W.: dat man gran’ extra special tip
foh Mistah Fox in de las’ race.”</p>

<p>Then he said to himself solemnly:</p>

<p>“Mistah Clarence Fox, yoh done broke. Yoh
broke, on’y yoh doan’ know it.”</p>

<p>With the aid of the telegraph operator in the
office upstairs, Pro evolved a telegram to himself,
and early the next afternoon, as Mr. Clarence
Fox, attired in the gorgeous clothes purchased
with the illicit profits of the Ivory Garter
race, entered the hotel, a negro bell-boy,
propelled by the telegraph operator, hastened
through the lobby.</p>

<p>“Mistah Prosias Trimble!” he paged. “Mistah
Prosias Trimble!”</p>

<p>“Hyah, niggah,” the captain called sharply.
“Ain’ Ah gwine tell yoh not foh to be pagin’
dat name ’roun’ de hotel? Dat Pro down in
de baf-house.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clarence Fox was two steps behind the
bell-boy when the telegram was delivered to Pro.</p>

<p>“Wha’ he say dis time, Pro?” he demanded
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Ain’t open it yet,” said Pro carelessly, moving
as if to place the telegram in his pocket.
“Ain’t openin’ tellygrafs while folks is pesticatin’
’roun’.”</p>

<p>“Yoh ain’t gwine t’row me down now, is yoh,
Pro?” Mr. Fox’s voice was tremulous with
surprised disappointment.</p>

<p>“Ain’ sayin’ Ah is, is Ah?”</p>

<p>“Ain’ hearin’ yoh sayin’ yoh ain’t,” retorted
Mr. Fox. “’Membah yoh done mek a ’greement
’bout dat tip.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Ain’t suah dis de tip,” Pro countered.
“Reckon Ah bettah read it.”</p>

<p>He ripped open the envelope and held the
inclosed message at a tantalizing angle so that
no craning of the neck of Mr. Fox sufficed to
give him a glimpse of the contents.</p>

<p>“Wha’ yoh make ob dat?” Pro exclaimed as
in surprise. “Mist’ Jim suah gittin’ good, hittin’
’em hahd.”</p>

<p>“Wha’ he say?”</p>

<p>“He say plenty,” said Pro mysteriously.
“Dis clean-up day.”</p>

<p>“Wha’ hoss he name?” quavered Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>“Hoss? He done name three hosses—two hot
tip an’ a gran’ special extra br’ilin’ hot one.”</p>

<p>“Gimme dem names, Pro.” Mr. Fox, feeling
the urge of excitement, reached as if to take the
telegram from Pro.</p>

<p>“Han’s off, niggah, han’s off!” Pro warned,
scowling belligerently.</p>

<p>“Ain’t us pahtners in dis?” quavered Mr.
Fox.</p>

<p>“Um. Ain’ so suah ’bout dat yit,” said Pro,
exasperatingly cool.</p>

<p>“But us made a ’greement.”</p>

<p>“Ah ’membahs dat,” Pro admitted, as if reluctantly.
“Le’s see, dey’s a hoss in de fust
race, dey’s a hoss in de third race, an’ de gran’
special suah thing in de las’. Reckon Ah tip
yoh one at a time.”</p>

<p>“Wha’ de fust, den?” pleaded Mr. Fox humbly.</p>

<p>“How much yoh ’low yoh bet on dat fust
hoss?”</p>

<p>“Depen’s.”</p>

<p>“Ain’ tippin’ nuffin’ on no ‘depen’s’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“Ef it look good, Ah bet fifty dollah.” Mr.
Fox stated the figure tentatively.</p>

<p>“Fifty dollah? Ah ain’ tippin’ no pikahs.”</p>

<p>“Ah bets a hunnerd ef de price look right.”</p>

<p>“Ain’ tippin’ nuffin’ on no ‘ifs.’”</p>

<p>“Ah bets a hunnerd dollah on dat fust hoss.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fox had surrendered, and he stated the
figure with the air of a man paying through
the nose.</p>

<p>“An’ fohty pussent foh me?”</p>

<p>“Dat ouh ’greement, Pro.”</p>

<p>“Dat hoss’ name,” said Pro, opening the message
and stopping in maddening deliberation—“dat
hoss’ name—how Ah know yoh play
faih?”</p>

<p>“Yoh knows me, Pro.”</p>

<p>“Uh—reckon Ah do, Clarence.”</p>

<p>“Den, what dat hoss’ name?”</p>

<p>Mr. Fox’s voice bore a note of irritation, and
Pro hastened to ease the situation.</p>

<p>“K-u-n-n-e-l C-a-m-p-b-e-l-l,” Pro spelled
from the message. “Kunnel Campbell—dat
good hoss. Mist’ Jim bin hol’in’ him foh a
killin’. Ought git a good price on dat hoss,
Clarence.”</p>

<p>“Kunnel Campbell,” repeated Mr. Fox.
“Ah’s gwine. Ah’ll be back atter dat race.”</p>

<p>“Ah’ll be waitin’ wif de second hoss,” Pro
promised.</p>

<p>When Mr. Fox disappeared with more haste
than dignity, Pro threw back his head and indulged
in prolonged laughter.</p>

<p>“Mistah Fox,” he repeated, “yoh done broke—yoh
broke, on’y yoh doan’ know it yit.”</p>

<p>For an hour and a half Pro tasted the sweets
of vengeance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“He say he bet a hunnerd,” he soliloquized.
“Dat mean he bet two hunnerd, mebby two
hunnerd an’ fifty, an’ lie me outen mah share
ef he win. When he lose he ’low he bet foah
hunnerd.”</p>

<p>He was rehearsing reasons for the defeat of
Colonel Campbell and additional reasons for increasing
the size of the next bet, when the door
opened and Mr. Fox, wildly agitated and with
shining face, hurtled into the bath-house.</p>

<p>“Did—did—did he win?” Pro’s eyes were
bulging.</p>

<p>“Did he win? We kill’m, Pro!” panted Mr.
Fox. “Done clean up Rampaht Street. Gimme
dat nex’ tip.”</p>

<p>“Wha’—wha’—what odds yoh git?” Pro,
dazed with the unexpectedness of developments,
managed to gasp.</p>

<p>“Niggah on’y lay me five to one,” lied Mr.
Fox breathlessly. “Ah bets a hunnerd at five
to one. We win five hundred dollah.”</p>

<p>“Wha’ dem ticket?”</p>

<p>“Dat a s’picious niggah gamblah, Pro,” said
Mr. Fox. “He done say he ain’ makin’ no
ticket, foh fear de p’lice git evidence.”</p>

<p>Pro saw the uselessness of argument.</p>

<p>“Two hunnerd—dat mah share,” he stated,
after an arithmetical parturition. “Gimme dat
money.”</p>

<p>“Ah ain’ c’lect yit.”</p>

<p>“Bettah c’lect foh Ah tell yoh dat nex’ hoss.”</p>

<p>“Ain’ got time befoh de next race.”</p>

<p>“Den pay me yohsef.”</p>

<p>“An’ take chances dat niggah welch?”</p>

<p>“Reckon’ Ah keep dat nex’ tip foh mahsef.”</p>

<p>“Ah’ll take de chanst,” Mr. Fox decided.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
“Ah low dat niggah pay, lessen he done
broke.”</p>

<p>He counted two hundred dollars off a huge
roll of bills and passed them to Pro reluctantly.</p>

<p>“How much yoh ’low yoh bet dis time?”
demanded Pro, recounting the money.</p>

<p>“Reckon Ah shoot another hunnerd.”</p>

<p>“A hunnerd, an’ all dat gravy in de bowl!”
Pro registered indignant protest. “Yoh gwine
shoot two hunnerd or nothin’. Dat’ll leave yoh
on velvet, an’ de special extra comin’.”</p>

<p>“Ah’s gamblin’,” Mr. Fox declared shortly.
“What his name?”</p>

<p>“An’ mek de bets whar dey writes de tickets?”
Pro added, imposing a new condition.</p>

<p>“Ah knows a place.”</p>

<p>“An’ fohty pussent foh me?”</p>

<p>“Dat ouh ’greement.”</p>

<p>“Dat nex’ hoss”—Pro studied the telegram
tantalizingly—“dat nex’ hoss J-a-k-m-i-n-o.”</p>

<p>“See yeh latah,” said Mr. Fox, dashing for
the exit.</p>

<p>“Wha’ yoh think ob dat?” Pro asked himself
wonderingly, as he felt the money to make certain
it was real. “Dat hoss ain’t got a chanst,
an’ he win!”</p>

<p>“Miss Luck she suah smile!” he continued.
“Ah kain’t lose, an’ Ah still break dat niggah.
Ah bets dat niggah bet three hunnerd dollar,
an’ git eight to one an’ pay me dis.”</p>

<p>The two hundred dollars suddenly decreased
in value by comparison with Clarence’s supposed
winnings. Then Pro’s face lighted.</p>

<p>“Ah’s <i>got</i> mine,” he reflected, “an’ Ah gwine
keep it. Wait twell Clarence done git de bad
news ’bout dat Jakmino race! Dat hoss ain’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
got no moah chanst ob winnin’ dan a niggah
has bein’ ’lected gubonor ob Louisiana.”</p>

<p>An hour later his comforting reflections were
interrupted by the second avalanche descent of
Clarence Fox into the bath-house. His eyes
were protruding and his face shining, and
money bulged from every pocket.</p>

<p>“Did—did—did—did dat one win, too?”
Pro’s eyes rolled wildly and amazement was
portrayed on every feature.</p>

<p>“He roll home, Pro!” cried Mr. Fox. “Win
all de way, by foah length. Ah lef’ a trail o’
bankrupt niggahs from de Levee to de basin.”</p>

<p>“What odds yoh git, niggah?” demanded
Pro, suddenly stern.</p>

<p>“Ah git seben,” Mr. Fox lied cautiously.
“What yoh git?”</p>

<p>“Ah git nine foh mine,” Pro lied. “Show
me dem ticket.”</p>

<p>“Ah git nine foh paht o’ mine, too,” declared
Mr. Fox, weakening.</p>

<p>“Ah git seben foh a hunnerd, an’ nine foh
a hunnerd. Hyar de ticket foh de nine. Dat
othah niggah de one dat doan’ write no ticket.”</p>

<p>“Pay me, niggah!” said Pro sternly. “Pay
me six hunnerd an’ forty dollar.”</p>

<p>“Count it yohsef,” said Mr. Fox, suddenly
reckless in his prosperity as he dragged money
from pockets and tossed it in scrambled heaps
on the cigar counter. “Count dat triflin’ six
hunnerd an’ fohty dollah, an’ tell me dat special.
Ah gwine staht an epidemic ob bankruptcy
’mongst dem niggah gamblahs from de
levee to de lake.”</p>

<p>Pro counted his share, feeling the money as
if striving to make certain he was awake. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
eyes rolled, and he blinked. He knew Mr. Fox
had won more than he admitted winning, but
in his amazement he failed to feel even resentment.</p>

<p>“Git a move on, niggah,” commanded Mr.
Fox. “Doan’ be all day countin’ dat triflin’
money. Le’s go git de real coin. What dat
las’ hoss’ name?”</p>

<p>Pro arose, stuffed his share of the loot into his
pockets, shoved the remainder back toward Mr.
Fox, and suddenly gave voice to long pent feelings.</p>

<p>“Run ’long an’ <i>guess</i>, niggah, <i>guess</i>,” he said
witheringly. “Ah’s done tippin’ lyin’, stealin’,
cheatin’ niggahs.”</p>

<p>“What yoh mean?” demanded Mr. Fox, but
weakly. “Ain’ Ah done slip yoh eight hunnerd
an’ forty dollah?”</p>

<p>“Yoh suah done so,” admitted Pro, “an’ yeh
done win twicet ez much ez yoh ’mit yoh win.
Ah mean yoh done cheat an’ lie an’ steal. Ah
say Ah’s done, an’ Ah mean Ah’s done. Hyah
whar yoh an’ me paht. Ah do mah own bettin’,
an’ Ah doan’ tip no pikah.”</p>

<p>He strode indignantly from the bath-house,
leaving Mr. Fox crushed. Presently he rallied
and pursued, striving to learn what horse Prosias
was betting on.</p>

<p>Up narrow stairways and down narrower
steps into basements, into rooms behind pool
parlors and rooms behind barber shops, into
cigar stands, Pro dashed and dodged, leaving
behind him a trail of quaking, alarmed colored
men. The word spread over New Orleans that
Prosias Trimble was plunging, but the bookmakers,
anxious to lay off the bets, were close-mouthed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> 
and Clarence Fox strove in vain to discover
which horse Pro was playing. By fifties,
twenty-fives, and hundreds, Pro wagered his
discounted share of Clarence Fox’s winnings,
and slowly the odds on Irene W. to win the last
race at Baltimo’ were driven downward from
forty to one to six to one.</p>

<p>Just before post time for the final race, Pro,
flushed and breathless, wagered the last ten dollars
and stood in a small room where a telegraph
operator clicked away at a key and received the
news from the distant track.</p>

<p>“Two hundred at fohty mek eight thousan’,”
he figured, “a hunnerd at thutty mek three
thousan’, a hunnerd at twenty-five mek two
thousan’ five hunnerd.”</p>

<p>Laboriously he checked off his bets and strove
to strike the total.</p>

<p>“Ah win t’irteen thousan’ fibe hunnerd dollah,”
he said dazedly. “Add dat eight hunnerd
an’ fohty, and dat’ll mek me win fo’teen thousan’
t’ree hunnerd an’ fohty dollah.”</p>

<p>“Ah ’low when Ah gits to Baltimo’ Ah staht
a stable ob hosses,” he said. “Ah ’low Ah call
it de Miss Luck Stable. Mah colahs will be
scahlet an’ puhple, wif a yaller sash an’ a green
cap—”</p>

<p>His reverie was interrupted by the man at
the telegraph instrument calling aloud what the
clicking instrument told him.</p>

<p>“Mai-Blanc at the quarter,” he said. “Mayor
Behrmann second, Maude G. third. At the
half: Mai-Blanc leads, Chicago Fritz second,
Mayor Behrmann third. The three quarters:
Mayor Behrmann by half a length, Mai-Blanc
second, Al Kray third.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“Hyar come Irene,” said Pro softly to himself,
seeing with the eyes of desire.</p>

<p>“Stretch, the same,” said the caller wearily.
“The winner—”</p>

<p>There was another long pause, and Pro, swallowing
hard, said:</p>

<p>“Come on, yoh Irene W.!”</p>

<p>“The winner—Mayor Behrmann, Chicago
Fritz second, Vicksburg Sal third.”</p>

<p>Pro stood with his lower lip quivering and
his eyes big with bewilderment. Then he edged
slowly toward the operator. “Mistah,” he said,
striving to speak casually, “Irene W. wah
scratched in dat race, wah she?”</p>

<p>“Irene W.?” said the operator disdainfully.
“Bah! She ran last.”</p>

<p>Slowly, as if in a trance, Prosias made his
way down into the street and stood staring
across toward the barber shop of Clarence Fox.
Light broke upon his bewildered brain, and he
muttered:</p>

<p>“Ah done touted mahsef!”</p>
